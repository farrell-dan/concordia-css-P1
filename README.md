---

### [Exercise 6](./workshop/exercise-6/)

### [Exercise 10](./workshop/exercise-10-stretch/) - Stretch

Using CSS, create a button that animates on hover:

![stretch-1 goal](././lecture/assets/stretch-1-goal.gif)

- It should color to a dark-blue when focused. It should **not** have the typical "focus ring" (blue outline on MacOS, dotted outline on Windows).
- It should shrink when the mouse is held down on it.
- It should be animated

### Necessary properties/techniques

- You'll need the `:active` and `:focus` pseudoselectors
- You'll also need to use the `transform: scale` property for the size change, and the `transition` property for the animation.
- You can disable the outline with `outline: none`, but **you should only do this if you have an alternative focus state**. That outline is very important for keyboard users, to know which element is focused.
